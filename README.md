### River Cleaning Boat
## Project Title:
Water Trash Cleaner

## Overview:
The Water Trash Cleaner project is a robotic system designed to clean the surface of rivers and other water bodies by collecting floating waste and pollutants. Powered by Arduino and controlled via a radio transmitter, this system features a conveyor belt mechanism for trash collection and a weight sensor for real-time measurement of the collected waste.

## Key Features:

Remote Control: Navigate the boat using a 4CH radio transmitter and receiver.
Trash Collection: A conveyor belt efficiently picks up surface-level waste and deposits it into a collection bin.

Real-Time Data Display: An integrated weight sensor measures the weight of collected trash and displays it on an LCD.
Cost-Effective and Scalable: Designed with easily available components for affordability and future scalability.

## Components:
Hardware:
Arduino UNO
4CH PCB Transmitter and Receiver
DC Motors (4)
Motor Driver (L293D)
LCD Display (16x2)
Resistors, Jumper Wires, Breadboard, Acrylic Sheets, Plastic Bottles, Wheels
9V Batteries (2)
Software:
Arduino IDE
Installation and Setup:

## Hardware Assembly:
Mount the components (Arduino, motors, conveyor belt, etc.) onto the base (acrylic sheet).
Attach plastic bottles for floatation and wheels for mobility.
Connect the circuit as per the schematic provided in the documentation.
#Software Installation:
Install the Arduino IDE on your computer.
Upload the provided source code to the Arduino UNO using a USB cable.

## Testing:
Power on the system and ensure all components are functioning.
Use the remote control to navigate the boat and test the trash collection and weight display mechanisms.

## Usage Instructions:
Power on the system and ensure the green LED is lit.
Use the remote control to move the boat across the water surface.
The conveyor belt will automatically collect floating waste and deposit it into the bin.
Monitor the LCD for real-time weight data of the collected trash.
After operation, manually remove the collected trash from the bin for disposal.

## Applications:
River and lake cleaning
Environmental conservation efforts
Public and industrial waste management

## Future Enhancements:
Integration of solar power for energy efficiency
Addition of GPS navigation and tracking
AI-based waste detection and prioritization
Multi-layer cleaning capability
